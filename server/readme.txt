- Make sure you have installed Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to run the server

- This is how I initialised Node js project: $ npm init -y

    - Then installed Express: $ npm install Express

    - Install cors for cross origin request (having backend and frontend at different servers): $ npm install cors

    - Installed multer to handle image uplaodes: $ npm install multer

    - For date time support $ npm install uuid 

                    OR

    - npm install


- To run server: $ node server.js
